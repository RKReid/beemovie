- who is't's yond?
- barry benson. 
 
  
from the honey trial?! oh, most wondrous. 
 
  
vanessa, this is nothing m're
than a big metal bee. 
 
  
t's did get giant wings, huge engines. 
 
  
i can't flyeth a plane. 
 
  
- wherefore not? isn't john travolta a piloteth?
- aye. 
 
  
how hard couldst t beest?

  
waiteth, barry!
we're head'd into some lightning. 
 
  
this is bob bumble.  We has't some
late-breaking news from jfk airp'rt,

  
wh're a suspenseful scene
is developing. 
 
  
barry benson,
green from his legal vict'ry. 
 
  
yond's barry!

  
. is attempting to landeth a plane,
load'd with people, floweth'rs

  
and an incapacitat'd flight crew. 
 
  
floweth'rs?!

  
we has't a st'rm in the area
and two individuals at the controls

  
with absolutely nay flight exp'rience. 
 
  
just a minute. 
 th're's a bee on yond plane. 
 
  
i'm quite familiar with mr.  Benson
and his no-account compadres. 
 
  
those gents've done enow damageth. 
 
  
but isn't that gent thy only desire?

  
technically, a bee
shouldn't beest able to flyeth at all. 
 
  
their wings art too bawbling. 
 
  
haven't we hath heard this a million times?

  
"the surface area of the wings
and corse mass maketh nay senseth. "

  
- receiveth this on the air!
- did get t. 
 
  
- standeth by. 
 - we're going liveth. 
 
  
the way we w'rk may beest a myst'ry to thee. 
 
  
making honey doth take a lot of bees
doing a lot of bawbling jobs. 
 
  
but alloweth me bid thee about a bawbling job. 
 
  
if 't be true thee doth t well,
t maketh a big diff'rence. 
 
  
m're than we did realize. 
 to us, to ev'ryone. 
 
  
yond's wherefore i wanteth to receiveth bees
backeth to w'rking togeth'r. 
 
  
yond's the bee way!
we're not madeth of jell-o. 
 
  
we receiveth behind a fellow. 
 
  
- black and yellow!
- holla!

  
hath left, right, down, hov'r. 
 
  
- hov'r?
- f'rget hov'r. 
 
  
this isn't so hard. 
 beep-beep! beep-beep!

  
barry, what hath happened?!

  
waiteth, i bethink we w're
on autopilot the whole timeth. 
 
  
- yond may has't been helping me. 
 - and anon we're not!

  
so t turns out i cannot flyeth a plane. 
 
  
all of thee, alloweth's receiveth
behind this fellow! moveth t out!

  
moveth out!

  
our only chance is if 't be true i doth what i'd doth,
thee copyeth me with the wings of the plane!

  
has't not to yelleth. 
 
  
i'm not yelling!
we're in a lot of ado. 
 
  
t's v'ry hard to concentrateth
with yond panicky tone in thy voice!

  
t's not a tone.  I'm panicking!

  
i can't doth this!

  
vanessa, pulleth yourself togeth'r. 
 thee has't to snap out of t!

 i bethink i'm humour something.

pulleth f'rward.  Nose down.  Tail up.

- this is insane, barry!
- this's the only way i knoweth how to flyeth.
